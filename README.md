# Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

## Overview
The Brain Tumor Detection and Classification project aims to detect and classify brain tumors using medical imaging data. This README file provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, and instructions for usage.

## Features
The project offers the following features:
1. Brain Tumor Detection: Given a medical image of the brain, the system can detect the presence of a brain tumor.
2. Brain Tumor Classification: If a tumor is detected, the system can classify the tumor into specific categories, such as benign or malignant.
3. Segmentation: The system can segment the tumor region within the brain image, highlighting the affected area.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the brain tumor detection and classification system:
1. Upload a brain image: Select a brain image in common image format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) using the file upload functionality in the user interface.
2. Analyze the results: The system will process the image and provide the following information:
a. Tumor detection: Whether a brain tumor is present or not.
b. Tumor classification: If a tumor is detected, the type of tumor (benign/malignant) will be provided.
c. Segmentation: If a tumor is detected, the system will outline the tumor region within the brain image.
3. Repeat: You can upload and analyze multiple images consecutively by following the same steps.

## Training
To train the brain tumor detection and classification model, the following steps were followed:
1. Dataset preparation: A dataset consisting of brain images with corresponding tumor labels was collected. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets.
2. Preprocessing: The images were preprocessed by normalizing pixel intensities, resizing them to a consistent resolution, and augmenting the data to increase the diversity of the training set.
3. Model architecture: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was designed, consisting of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model was trained using the training set and optimized using appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms.
4. Model evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on the validation set to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. The model was fine-tuned based on the evaluation results.
5. Model deployment: The trained model weights were saved and can be loaded to perform brain tumor detection and classification tasks.
